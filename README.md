# SpringBoot_Crud_Application.
A Spring Boot CRUD application is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Boot framework to perform basic data operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)—commonly needed in managing persistent data. Such applications typically expose RESTful APIs to manage resources, often backed by a database like MySQL database.
